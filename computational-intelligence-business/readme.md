> Predicting Price Movements with Genetic Algorithms

## spec
- Implement a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to create a predicting algorithm to identify price movements over a specific time window
- 3 components
  - Modelling: decide what will be in input values to the GA
  - Implementation: decide on the individual representation and the fitness function; and implement a GA that given a set of data, optimizes a forecasting rule
  - Report: complete a set of experiments and compile the results
