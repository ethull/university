Project 10 is a syntax analyzer for the jack high level language. Its first component is a tokenizer that converts a jack file to a stream of tokens. The parse component goes over the stream of tokens and while checking it fits the jack grammer it generates an xml output.

The Parse.java file handles the parse component.
